Tiredness tracker built using computer vision.

Project description:
The application will be open while the user does work at computer. 
While the application is running, the application will log the user's state, example details include:
looking at the screen or not
blinking rate
eyes closed or not
how open eyes are

Data about the user's state will be logged, and generated into a visible format (possibly a timeline or a calendar).

User can store work logs, and can compile statistics.

Todo:

-**Create the ai that will track the user's state**
  -Drowsiness
  -If user is looking at screen
  -Blink rate
  -General facial features(?)
  
  Research required
  
-Create the data structure that will hold user's state at a timestamp
-Create the visualization that will take in a series of userstate timestamps
 
Tools needed:
tkinter, opencv, random shit
